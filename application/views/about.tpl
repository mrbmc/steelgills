	<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>I want a better logbook for my dives so I created steel gills to make logging 
dives fun and easy.</p> 

<p>Paper logbooks can't be searched or shared and expensive dive computers are 
too complicated. Along the way we found all kinds of awesome features we could 
build and ways to share dives with friends.</p>

<p>I started diving in 1997 in the Cayman Islands. In 2000 I completed my PADI 
dive master training. Since then he has dove in Aruba, Belize, Israel &amp; 
Egypt, and Mexico.</p>
